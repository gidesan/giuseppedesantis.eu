*Hi! Weekly Notes are dev stuff worth reading. For me at least, maybe for you as well.*

With **React Hooks** you can add [state](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html#-state-hook), [side effects](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html#%EF%B8%8F-effect-hook) and much more to [function components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components).

Need a starting point? Go with [this post](https://dev.to/dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-2eib) by Dan Abramov and 
the always up-to-date [official docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
 
[This article](https://itnext.io/why-reacts-hooks-api-is-a-game-changer-8731c2b0a8c) by Rudi Yardley tells why hooks can be a game changer and why they could be better than [render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) and [higher order components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html).

You can create [custom hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) to fit your needs: the awesome react community is [already doing it](https://github.com/kitze/react-hanger).

One more thing before you start coding: don't use hooks in production, they're still in **alpha** stage!
